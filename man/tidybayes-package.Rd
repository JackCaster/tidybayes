\title{Tidy Data and 'Geoms' for Bayesian Models}
\description{
\code{tidybayes} is an R package that aims to make it easy to integrate
popular Bayesian modeling methods into a tidy data + ggplot workflow.

data frames (one observation per row) are particularly convenient for
use in a variety of R data manipulation and visualization packages.
However, when using Bayesian modeling functions like JAGS or Stan in R,
we often have to translate this data into a form the model understands,
and then after running the model, translate the resulting sample (or
predictions) into a more tidy format for use with other R functions.
\code{tidybayes} aims to simplify these two common (often tedious)
operations. It also provides a variety of ggplot geometries aimed
at making the visualization of model output easier.

For a comprehensive overview of the package, see \code{vignette("tidybayes")}.
For overviews aimed at the \code{rstanarm} and \code{brms} packages, see
\code{vignette("tidy-rstanarm")} and \code{vignette("tidy-brms")}. For an overview
of the majority of geoms in tidybayes, see \code{vignette("slabinterval")}.
