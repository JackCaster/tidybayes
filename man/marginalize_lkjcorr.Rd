\title{Turn spec for LKJ distribution into spec for marginal LKJ distribution}
\usage{
marginalize_lkjcorr(data, K, dist = ".dist", args = ".args")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing a column with distribution names (\code{".dist"} by default)
and a list column of distribution arguments (\code{".args"} by default), such as output by
\code{\link{parse_dist}}.}

\item{K}{Dimension of the correlation matrix. Must be greater than or equal to 2.}

\item{dist}{The name of the column containing distribution names. See \code{\link{parse_dist}}.}

\item{args}{The name of the column containing distribution arguments. See \code{\link{parse_dist}}.}
}
\description{
Turns specs for an LKJ correlation matrix distribution as returned by
\code{\link{parse_dist}} into specs for the marginal distribution of
a single cell in an LKJ-distributed correlation matrix (i.e., \code{\link{lkjcorr_marginal}}).
Useful for visualizing prior correlations from LKJ distributions.
}
\details{
The LKJ(eta) prior on a correlation matrix induces a marginal prior on each correlation
in the matrix that depends on both the value of \code{eta} \emph{and} \code{K},the dimension
of the \eqn{K \times K}{KxK} correlation matrix. Thus to visualize the marginal prior
on the correlations, it is necessary to specify the value of \code{K}, which depends
on what your model specification looks like.

Given a data frame representing parsed distribution specifications (such
as returned by \code{\link{parse_dist}}), this function updates any rows with \code{.dist == "lkjcorr"}
so that the first argument to the distribution is equal to the specified dimension
of the correlation matrix (\code{K}) and changes the distribution name to \code{"lkjcorr_marginal"},
allowing the distribution to be easily visualized using the \code{\link{stat_dist_slabinterval}}
family of ggplot2 stats.

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Say we have an LKJ(3) prior on a 2x2 correlation matrix. We can visualize
# its marginal distribution as follows...
data.frame(prior = "lkjcorr(3)") \%>\%
  parse_dist(prior) \%>\%
  marginalize_lkjcorr(K = 2) \%>\%
  ggplot(aes(y = prior, dist = .dist, args = .args)) +
