\title{Area function + point + interval meta-geom}
\usage{
geom_area_interval(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., scale = 0.9, side = c("topright",
  "top", "right", "bottomleft", "bottom", "left", "both"),
  orientation = c("horizontal", "vertical"), na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link{aes}} or \code{\link{aes_string}}. Only needs to be set at the
layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this layer.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{layer}}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing
values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{Should this layer be included in the legends? Default is \code{c(size = FALSE)}, unlike most geoms,
to match its common use cases. \code{FALSE} hides all legends, \code{TRUE} shows all legends, and \code{NA} shows only
those that are mapped (the default for most geoms).}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with them. This is
most useful for helper functions that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behavior from the
default plot specification, e.g. borders.}
}
\description{
This meta-geom supports drawing combinations of functions (as areas), points, and intervals. It acts as a meta-geom
for implementing eye plots, half-eye plots, CCDF barplots, and point+multiple interval plots with horizontal or
vertical orientations, and with appropriate support for dodging.
}
\details{
\code{geom_area_interval} is a flexible meta-geom that you can use directly, though in most cases you will want to
use shortcut geoms that combine appropriate stats with this geom to create more useful primitives, such as eye plots,
halfeye plots, point+interval plots, or CCDF barplots.

See \code{\link{geom_lineribbon}} for a similar geom designed for curves plus probability bands. See
\code{\link{geom_pointrange}} and \code{\link{geom_pointrangeh}} for the geoms these are based on.
