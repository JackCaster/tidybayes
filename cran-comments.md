## Resubmission
This is a resubmission addressing adding `svglite` as a dependency in `Suggests`.

## Submission comments
This submisison is primarily to address this message from Brian Ripley:

I have adjusted the usage of rstanarm (and a few other packages with the
same problem) to only be used conditionally.

A few other minor changes have also been made since the previous release.

## Test environments
* Windows 10 (local), R-release 3.5.1
* Windows 10 (local), R-devel 3.6.0 2018-10-19 r75470
* Windows (win-builder), R-release 3.5.1
* Windows (win-builder), R-devel
* Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS (local), R-release 3.5.1
